# cw-gearbox
Add manual gearing to you vehicles. 

### Key Features:

- Manual Gear Controls: Take full control of your vehicle's gears, enhancing realism and immersion.
- Efficient Resource Management: Minimize resource consumption for optimal client performance. Running at a 0.0ms resmon on idle and a 0.02ms when driving a manual
- Clutch Simulation: Experience authentic clutch engagement, adding depth to your driving interactions.
- Synchronized Gear Changes
- Support for oxlib and QBcore (for notifications and keybind)

> ‚ùó Hot tip:  Read the damn readme and config before reporting issues

> "b-b-b but Coffee, I use ESX on my server will this work?". No. But I'm pretty sure it will if you change those like two lines using QBCore in client.lua. 

## Comes ready for [CW-Tuning](https://cw-scripts.tebex.io/package/5987879) transmissions
Check the Config for `UseOtherCheck` if you want to implement another script for swappable transmissions
> As of the release of this. CW-Tuning also recieved an update (see our Discord for patch notes)

## Limitations
- Limited to the vehicles original amount of gears (no extra from upgrade for example)
- Doesn't work well with gears over 5
- Doesn't handle gear ratios, only uses default ones
- This script in itself doesn't add any transmission swapping. You need to enable it in the vehicle handling files if you do not use something like [CW-Tuning](https://cw-scripts.tebex.io/package/5987879)
- **Can _not_ be** applied to vehicles that do not already have the `strAdvancedFlags` in it's handling.meta file
- Only tested with OxLib for keybind, but has code for basic keybinds also
- Supports oxlib or qbcore for notify (legit one line to change if you want something else tho)
